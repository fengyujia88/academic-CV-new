**In this project, I was responsible for both the bioinformatics analysis and latent class analysis sections, and I also wrote the latent class analysis section of the proposal. The bioinformatics analysis involved analyzing the GSE113969 dataset to identify key genes and generate volcano plots, heat plots, protein interaction network diagrams, GO enrichment plots, and KEGG tables. These findings can be further validated through animal experiments and clinical patient specimens. The latent class analysis section primarily utilized Mplus software and R to identify homogeneous groups with similar characteristics and prognoses in Hubei province, facilitating the implementation of targeted intervention measures.**
