**In this project, I published an article as the first author**

**In the process of conducting latent class analysis using Mplus, I discovered that Mplus required manual looping for each category. During the exploration, I also found that R could be used for latent class analysis without the need for manual looping**, resulting in higher efficiency and faster analysis speed. However, there was a lack of comprehensive analysis tutorials in mainland China. Consequently, I took the initiative to self-learn the use of R's poLCA package for latent class analysis through the R official website. Later on, to assist other researchers in learning this more efficient analysis method, I documented the specific analysis steps in an article, which was eventually published.
