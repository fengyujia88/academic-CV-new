## Overview

1. On World Hypertension Day, my guidance instructors, fellow students, and I provided free medical consultations, conducted blood pressure measurements, and offered medication guidance to patients in need at the outpatient clinic.  
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more
