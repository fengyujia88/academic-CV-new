**Abstract**  
**Objective:** To clarify the connection between TPX2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of bladder
cancer, so as to evaluate the function of TPX2 as a prognosis marker in bladder cancer.  
**Methods:** GEO datasets were collected
and expression profile and clinical information were analyzed. GSEA was conducted to explore the gene sets enriched in TPX2
high-expression samples.  
**Results:** The expression of TPX2 was up-regulated in bladder cancer (P<0.0001); TPX2 expression was
significantly associated with age, sex, T stage, N stage, progression, grade. Higher expression of TPX2 indicated poor prognosis in
bladder cancer. GSEA indicated that TPX2 regulates gene sets associated with spermatogenesis,unfolded protein response, PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling, mTORC1 signaling, cholesterol homeostasis, mitotic spindle, glycolysis, G2M checkpoint, E2Ftargets,
myctargets.  
**Conclusion:** TPX2 is highly expressed in multiple tumors and functions as potential marker and target in diagnosis and
treatment in bladder cancer.
