**Abstract**  
The robumeta package provides functions for performing robust variance meta-regression.
Traditional means of meta-regression couldnâ€™t deal with the complicated and unknown correlations among
dependent effect sizes. The robumeta package provides a new method of using different weighting schemes to
establish both large and small sample robust variance estimation (RVE) to performing robust variance metaregression.
The traditional RVE can just use in the large sample, but it can be used in the small sample after some
adjustments have been done. This article uses examples to introduce the whole functions of robumeta package
in performing robust variance meta-regression, including data preparation, calculation implementation, result
summary, and plots drawing.
