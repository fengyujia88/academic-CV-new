**Abstract**  
**Objective:** To investigate the expression of kinesin family member 2C ( KIF2C) in bladder cancer ( BC) utilizing GEO datasets, to clarify the relationship between KIF2C expression and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with BC, and to evaluate the possibility of using KIF2C as a prognosis marker in BC.  
**Methods:** BC gene expression studies were collected and the relationship between expression level of KIF2C and clinical information were analyzed． Gene sets en- richment analysis ( GSEA) was conducted to explore the gene sets enriched in KIF2C high-expres- sion samples.  
**Results:** The expression of KIF2C was up-regulated in BC ( P＜0．000 1) ; KIF2C ex- pression was significantly associated with progression, grade, T stage, and N stage． Higher expres- sion of KIF2C indicated poor prognosis in BC． GSEA indicated that KIF2C regulated gene sets asso- ciated with ribosomalprotein, polycombprotein, endogenous ribonuclease, E2F, and anti-oncogene RB.  
**Conclusion:** KIF2C is highly expressed in BC and functions as a potential marker and target for diagnosis and treatment of BC.
