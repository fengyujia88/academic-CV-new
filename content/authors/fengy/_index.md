Welcome to my personal website. I am a student from mainland China. 
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Clinical Medicine from Wuhan University and completed my Master's degree in Internal Medicine at Wuhan University. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Medicine at Monash University.
My current research interests lie in constructing AI models based on medical imaging.
